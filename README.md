### Synopsis

A pattern matching compiler for CS 557 final project.

### Running

Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/),
then run `stack ghci` to launch ghci. Run function `drive` to
explore the examples.

`drive` parses the type and
patterns from `examples/1.hs`, compiles
the last pattern, and writes to `1.dot`.

### Modules

- `ADT` defines the types in the language.
- `Backtrack` implements the backtracking automata compilation scheme,
using `Try` nodes to handle backtracking.
- `Backtrack2` implements the backtracking automata compilation scheme,
using explicit jumps to handle backtracking.
- `CompileUtils` contains the shared types and functions for all the
  compilation schemes.
- `DecisionTree` implements the decision tree compilation scheme.
- `DecisionTreeOpt` implements several optimizations that's can be applied
to the code generated by the decision tree scheme.
- `Driver` contains example code to parse and compile files.
- `Eval` contains the semantics for the pattern language and the compiled
code.
- `Naive` implements a naive (top-to-down, left-to-right) compilation scheme.
- `Pat` defines the patterns in the language.
- `Syntax` contains a Parsec-based parser for the language.
- `Visualize` renders generated flow graphs into Dot files.
